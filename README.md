# aws-docker-lambda-terraform

This repository demonstrates how to deploy:

* An [AWS Lambda function](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/)
* That runs a [Python function](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-python.html)
* Which runs in a [Docker image](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/python-image.html)
* Which is built using [HashiCorp Packer](https://developer.hashicorp.com/packer/plugins/builders/docker)
* And deployed using [Terraform](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/lambda_function)

Test using the AWS Console.
